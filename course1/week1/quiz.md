# Linear models

1. Consider a vector (1,âˆ’2,0.5). Apply a softmax transform to it and enter the first component (accurate to 2 decimal places).
   - 0.60
2. Suppose you are solving a 5-class classification problem with 10 features. How many parameters a linear model would have? Don't forget bias terms!
   - 55
3. There is an analytical solution for linear regression parameters and MSE loss, but we usually prefer gradient descent optimization over it. What are the reasons?
   - [x] Gradient descent doesn't require to invert a matrix
   - [x] Gradient descent is more scalable and can be applied for problems with high number of features
